        What is happening in Ukraine?
      </h1>
      <h3>
        DEAR FRIENDS
      </h3>
      <p class="text-hero-base mb-2">
        These days the world's media focus upon Ukraine.
        We understand that not all people may know what is happening in Ukraine.
        We have collected information to help you better understand what the Ukrainian people are
        now experiencing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          On February 24, around 5 a.m., Russia began the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          Russian troops launched missile strikes against peaceful Ukrainian cities from various directions, including
          the temporarily occupied Donbas and Crimea and the northeastern region.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          Russia has struck military and strategically critical infrastructure all over the country.
          Borders are violated from the north, east, and the administrative border with Crimea.
          The Ukrainian Armed Forces are retaliating; the enemy has casualties.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          This is an act of war, an attack on Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, a gross violation of the
          UN Charter and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.
          Accordingly, Ukraine has activated its right to self-defense under international law.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          The situation is challenging. Russia's primary goal is to destabilize our state, destroy institutions and
          raise panic in society.
        </li>
        <li class="text-hero-base mb-2">
          The Ukrainian people ask the world to respond as harshly as possible to what is happening. Ukraine calls on
          international partners to immediately apply a new round of meaningful sanctions, against the aggressor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-hero-base mb-2">
        It‚Äôs exactly the WAR, not ‚Äúmilitary operation‚Äù, as Putin said.
        Ukraine needs help of foreign governments in the form of intrusion of military contingent
