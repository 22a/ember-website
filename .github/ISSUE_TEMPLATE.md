### The goal

The goal of this entire repository is to recreate https://emberjs.com website as an Ember app.
The currently deployed site is a Ruby app found [in a different repository](https://github.com/emberjs/website),
and contributors are working towards converting the whole site over.
The routing names and the content should be the same as the live site.
A significant part of the work is just moving markup over and using some `{{#each}}` helpers in place of Ruby templating.
Wherever you can, keep it simple.
