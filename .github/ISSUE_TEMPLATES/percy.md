**Note:** when staring your PR on this issue, branch of `percy-magic` instead of
master.

We are in the final stages of the project to convert the Ember Website into an
Ember app üéâ Even though it may seem like the most difficult part is behind us
the **last mile** can often be the hardest. 

The original requirement of this site was to convert the technology but to
**not** change the design in any way. As such we have setup a PR that uses Percy
to check all **visual changes** against the previous website.
https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/185

Our Goal now is to make the number of Percy differences in that PR be as small
as possible. We are no longer merging anything to master, all new PRs are being
merged into that branch so that we can check it against master before merging.

If you want to get involved with this issue please comment on it to say that you
are interested in contributing and we will move it into in-progress. When
updating the styles for the specified page you should have the exiting website
open in a tab next to this app running locally. If you swap between your tab and
production and there is no change or movement then you are good to submit your
PR.

**Make sure to target the `percy-magic` branch** when submitting your PR üëç
